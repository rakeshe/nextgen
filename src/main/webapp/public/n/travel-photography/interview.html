<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Anywhere new :)  Preferably with wildlife, mountains or primitive cultures.  I do find myself returning to Alaska and Papua New Guinea.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
The Glenorchy board walk, it leaves right from the quaint township of Glenorchy at the head of lake Wakatipu and provides spectacular views and alpine reflections in  all directions.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>

Nikon D8000, Nikon 14-24, 24 -70, 70-200 and macro lens.  Other equipment is decided dependant on the location and subjects that I am shooting.</p>


<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Stay passionate, follow your dreams and don't be afraid to create your own unique style.  Everyone learns from their mistakes.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong> &nbsp;How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
On a high capacity laptop and also several external hard drives.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>

I don't tend to follow too many trends…  For me the most exciting path for 2013 is leading more photo tours in Alaska and Africa allowing me to share the passion for photography with other like minded people.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
I have so many and so many memorable stories, it's really hard to single one out…  At the moment I am feeling passionate about wildlife photography.  I have many favourites but one subject that always gets a lot of response is my images of breaching great white sharks in South Africa.  The sheer power of these huge sharks as they breach in pursuit of seals is like something from a Sci-fi movie, especially when they are so close…. And then there are elephants'…</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
Again its hard to choose individual subjects but one of them would have to be the primitive cultures of Papua New Guinea (featured above).</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br> Hill Inlet on Whitsunday Island is one of the most beautiful areas to photograph in the world.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br> There is a waterfall in The Kimberley called Atlantis Falls.  If I told you exactly where it was, it would no longer be a secret.  If people really want to find it, they will.  But I believe some places should be kept secret, as it's often the effort and adventure of getting to a location that gives it significance.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong> &nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br> My main camera is a Phase One system with a P280 digital back.  I also still shoot on film sometimes and my film camera is a Linhof 617S.  For candid and quick shots, I now use the new Lumix GX7.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br> Be patient.  Great photos are gifts that come when you spend time relating to people or the location you're in.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br> I carry 2 portable hard drives, which I keep in 2 separate locations.  One is usually in my luggage and the other is in my camera case or computer case.  That way, if one drive is lost or stolen, I still have all the images backed up.</p>  

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong> &nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br> The new Lumix micro 4/3 camera – the GX7 – is a game changer for the photographic industry.  It has extremely high quality and capability for shooting in very low light – for both stills and video.</p>  

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br> My favourite photo – and one that has become quite famous – is a shot called the Power of One.  I was on safari in Zimbabwe at a magical spot called Mana Pools.  This huge bull elephant walked right past our camp and down to the river, then swam out to the grassy islands in the middle of the mighty Zambesi. Our guide thought this might be a good opportunity for me to get close with my very wide angle camera, so we paddled out into the river and slowly moved closer to the big bull.  We kept a watchful eye for crocodiles and hippos, which are plentiful in this area.  In the distance, you can actually see hippopotamus on the river bank.  This elephant was only about 30 feet from us but my camera makes him appear further away.  You will notice his left ear is slightly blurred – that's because it was twitching.  Just as I took this shot, the elephant picked up our scent and began to charge. Fortunately for my racing heart, he stopped after only a few paces. He is an awesome sight -  a great elephant in the mighty Zambesi River.</p>  

<p class="border"><span class="number">8</span><strong> &nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br> The most inspiring photography I have ever done was on the set of The Passion of the Christ movie with Mel Gibson.  The sets were so well researched and realistic that it was like being transported back to the time of Christ.</p>                                                                           </div>

A national TV current affairs program described Ken as an "iconic Australian image maker" and a leading American gallery described him as "the Ansel Adams of colour photography".  His Limited Edition Art Prints grace the walls of fine homes and office suites right around the world.  Ken, however, describes himself as an average photographer, with a great God ... merely an interpreter of God's creation.  There is no doubt that God has given him a great gift to capture and present the splendour of His creation.<br>   Considered a master in his field of photography, Ken has won numerous awards both nationally and internationally for his images and publications – including the photographic industry's highest honour – the coveted Gold Tripod Award.         </p></div>         </div>  								</div> 							</li>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Iceland!</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
In Australia, much of the Eyre Peninsula remains relatively unphotographed. The granite rock formations , in particular Murphy's haystacks are one of my favourite. In New Zealand, one of my favourite hikes was up to the summit of Mount Roy. On a clear day, the visibility stretches beyond the end of <a href="http://www.hotelclub.com/New-Zealand/Wanaka-hotels/"target="_blank">Lake Wanaka</a> and into Mount Aspiring National Park.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
We take a 5dmk2, 5dmk3 and a 7d as a spare. Wide angle lenses include 16-35mm F2.8 II lens and 17-40mm F4 lens. We bring a 70-200mm F2.8 II lens and a 135mm F2 lens. As a walkaround lens outside of landscapes, we also carry a 24-70mm F2.8 lens. We carry a large assortment of filters including circular polarisers and GND filters. We also have two carbon fibre tripods.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
The most important tip is to give yourself ample opportunity to photograph locations. I think it is better to spend more time at one place rather than spending most of your time travelling and feeling fatigued.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
We store our images on a laptop as well as an external hard drive.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
The most exciting growth in photography has been that of social media. In many ways, this has made it easy to make any given photographer's work available to the public. This has meant that there is an absolute increase in the number of quality images out there, but the flipside is that there is probably relatively less quality images due to the sheer volume of average work.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
One of our favourite photographs is Marianne's image of Korpudalur in Iceland. At the end of a long Icelandic summer day on the road, we witnessed rays of horizontal light for an extended period of twilight transform the West Fjords into an even more magical place.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
The northern lights (aurora borealis). Coming from the southern hemisphere, we rarely see anything even resembling this phenomenon and when we finally witnessed it for the first time, it had us wanting to return in winter for more!</p>

Marianne Lim and Dylan Toh are both self-taught amateur photographers who are based in Adelaide , South Australia. Our love of photography grew from a desire to capture lasting impressions of our travels. As working professionals, we rely on photography to escape the routines of the working week. As new parents, we also hope to share the experience of nature with our child and hope that this contributes to the development of her own sense of adventure. We hope to convey a sense of awe, mood and appreciation through our photographs. We are ever in search of that one perfect moment, that one perfect scene which will give us that one perfect photograph. Walking paths both near and far will hopefully give us many more opportunities in the future to capture and share these scenes.

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Isn't it every travel photographers ultimate photography destination the World? I simply cannot choose just one location, my list is endless and until I scratch the service I don't have an ultimate travel destination.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
In my eyes the lush enchanted rainforest found along the East Coast of Australia is the most precious best kept secret from a photographers perspective. These wonderful places are untouched from the human destruction that is overdeveloping the world and holds great significance to life on Earth. I'd have to say the same for New Zealand's luscious forests.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
I have learnt to avoid the technique known as 'chimping', or in other words shooting an image and immediately reviewing it on the cameras LCD screen. Most DSLR cameras playback/review time is between 1-3 seconds and this timing can be crucial if photographing a high speed event and and constantly waiting to review your shot before firing your next frame. A better shot could be missed while you examine your previous photo. I now shoot more and review less to avoid missing any of the action.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
All my images are imported straight onto my Macbook Pro's internal 1TB drive and then backed up onto an external portable 1TB for extra security. This portable drive is kept offsite to be sure it's safe.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
'Within the past few years, mirrorless and Micro Four Thirds cameras have made their stamp on the industry and stolen attention from both the point and shoot and DSLR markets. With smaller sensors than their DSLR counterparts and more capable systems than entry-level cameras, they've become what're called the next-gen.'</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
The picture above I titled 'Mystic Jungle' would be my personal favourite. The bold and central composition is eye catching which has made it my most popular and recognised photo to date. Taken deep in World Heritage Dorrigo National Park - NSW, Australia. It was the perfect day for a trek in the forest, just after the rain had eased and the sun begun to shine from through the canopy. I still remember the excitement felt when seeing it on my cameras LCD screen for the first time, I knew I had created something special that would connect with people of all levels. It has been published worldwide in magazines, postcards, websites and only blogs everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
Tough Question, I cannot really answer it to be honest. My most inspiring photography trip was to <a href="http://www.hotelclub.com/Australia/Sydney-hotels/"target="_blank">Sydney</a> in Sept 2012. It was a spontaneous trip to photograph some new territory which ended up rewarding me with some incredibly successful pictures that have scored me contracts with tourism companies in Australia.</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
We have both always dreamed of doing an Alaskan RV mission from Spring until Autumn - but after 10 days with the kids in this campervan we might be holding that dream back for another 10 years or so.... a Fijian island with Kid's Club facilities would seem to offer plenty of photographic possibilities.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
The whole South Island of New Zealand!  There always seems to be another ridiculously photogenic spot around the corner - I'm writing this from a campervan parked next to a stunning west coast beach that I have never heard of, in fact, I doubt it even has a name.  Sarah & I spent the morning photographing this beach and we know for a fact that around the headland lies another stunning coastal location.  To single out one stupidly great spot over another simply seems unfair, if not impossible!</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
For landscape photography you really only need two or three lenses, a DSLR body and a tripod.  Of course Sarah & I never stick to this (because we also photograph people for our stock library during our travels).  Between the two of us, things rapidly spiral out of control - no matter the size of vehicle there is always stuff cascading out of doors and jammed under seats - our 6 year old daughter just had our son's compact camera bag fall on her head this morning thanks to some poor parental packing skills!</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Stay amateur. Let your boss worry about tax returns, bank managers, clients, marketing and bizarre government regulations.  Just build a website that looks like you are a pro and sell your images through the myriad of channels available on the web.  Good stock agencies are always on the lookout for great images and they don't care whether you are a grizzled full time photographer or a radiator hose pipe salesman - it is the quality of your images that counts. If after two years of this you find yourself lighting campfires with $100 bills then it may be time to go full time - that should quickly remedy your excess cash issues...</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
Haphazardly!  Sarah & I grew up on film and the digital transition was an iterative process so we have never really formalised a system. Having said that, we are borderline paranoids, so images get downloaded to a laptop, then backed up to USB-powered hard drive.  We don't re-use or erase the camera memory cards until we get back to the office, meaning we have three copies spread around the vehicle (the USB hard drive gets hidden somewhere in case of a break-in).  On big trips we will courier another hard drive back  to the office.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
Bellbottoms? shoulder pads? I'll leave the trends to the vespa-riding Instagram hipsters of Greenwich Village - I'm simply too old, uncool and lazy to be worried about trends.  Great photography is about unchanging fundamentals, composition, subject matter and, most of all, soul-stirringly great light.</p>
  
<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.sisson.co.nz/shop/shop-by-product/New-Zealand-canvas-prints/Canvas-Print-Milford-Sound-Rocks-Fiordland-NZ.html"target="_blank">This one</a> of a clearing storm over Mitre Peak in Milford Sound.  I just love this image, as it represents this incredible place in a way that I feel encapsulates how I felt when looking at the scene - it is brooding, dark yet calm and comfortable - to me, it has 'soul'.  Even better, it came about easily - I had been having a little snooze in the back of our SUV (after an early start - I swear) when my alarm went off.  After a frenzied stagger down to the beach, I snapped a few dozen images and then the light fizzled - I returned to the car and hit the sack again, a perfect day!</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
I would love to say the birth of my two children - but I failed spectacularly on both occasions (a career in war photography was not to be).  Instead, it would be a summer evening spent with the Yellow eyed penguins at Katiki Point near Moeraki, Otago.  There were a few people about but they all left to have their dinner I guess, because suddenly I was alone on the headland with these beautiful, and incredibly rare, birds wandering past me - it was surreal. For this shot I just lay in the grass and let this penguin walk on by - he or she stopped for a while to check me out and then left - a spiritual moment...</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Any place that has a vibrant (preferably ancient) culture, geographical diversity, interesting history and friendly people. 
South East Asia is my current favourite. India and South and Central America are high on my list of places to visit.</p> 

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
Well that would be telling... New Zealand's full of locations that have scarcely been photographed and one only has to get off the beaten track a little to find beautiful, lesser known places. The West Coast of the South Island for one has many seldom walked valleys.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
Canon 5D MKII, plus a 5DMKI as a spare. Canon 16-35mm f2.8L, Canon 24-70mm f2.8L, Sigma 70-200mm 2.8L, Sigma 15mm fisheye, plus tripod and filters. If I'm cycling I'll just carry one body and a Canon 24-105mm f4L plus a fisheye or a 50mm f1.8, and a light tripod.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Keep your camera as handy as possible and keep your kit simple and minimal. If it feels like a burden you're less likely to take it with you everywhere.</p>

<P><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I upload via Adobe Lightroom onto a 500GB USB-powered hard drive and then back up to a second hard drive. Processed and finished shots are uploaded to Smugmug as I travel.</P>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
Mirrorless body cameras. They're so much lighter and more compact. These are the future of professional level portable camera systems.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
A shot of a butcher, surrounded by animal carcasses that I took in a market in Shangri La (Zhongdian) in Yunnan, China while on a 13,000 km cycle tour through SE Asia. It's a simple, tightly framed shot that renders a scene that is typical for a market in China, but so very different to something you'd see in Western culture.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
Probably the Angkor temples in Cambodia, but photographing action sports such as climbing can have some inspiring moments too.</p>

<p class="border"><span class="number">9</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite travel photography blog?</strong><br>

<a href="http://stevemccurry.wordpress.com/"target="_blank">Steve McCurry's travel work</a> is a huge inspiration. He has a gifted eye for both composition and moment, and the ability to find beauty in the mundane.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
This is  the hardest question of all, as in our opinion Australia and New Zealand are two of the best countries in the world for wildlife photography.
If we had to say though we think Far North Queensland in Australia where we have the elusive Tree Kangaroo, the rare Cassowary & so much more.  Definitely Kaikoura in New Zealand. Where else in the world can you photograph Whales in the ocean with snow-capped mountains in the background?</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
Nikon D300S, Nikon D800, macro lens, wide angle lens, 24 -70 lens, 70-200 Nikon lens, Sigma 120-300 and 800 Nikon flash.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Avoid the crowds! Get up early! Catch the sunrise. The photographers light is the hour around sunrise and the hour around sunset.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>

Wildlife and the environment.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
Koala mother and baby in the wild on Magnetic Island. We visited Magnetic Island and on a bush walk on the Forts walks we come across a mother Koala with a baby in her pouch. This is very rare. We were patient and waited around and the baby slowly emerged from her pouch. We were able to photograph this beautiful baby as she was very curious and stayed out posing for us for a couple of hours before going back to the safety of her mother's pouch.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
The Rwanda Gorillas. This is our dream to go back with our new camera equipment. Our first visit we were still on film and had very old camera equipment. We often talk about what we could do now with our new equipment!</p>

I took a photograph of four sheep in a row under a tree in Balingup in WA. It was pouring with rain and as I drove along a country road I noticed these sheep walking single file near this amazing tree. I stopped the car, wound down the window and took a shot. It needed a lot of help in photoshop to bring the contrast back but it was a great composition. I entered it in the Australian Professional Photography Awards and it scored a gold. I was very happy with that.</p>

I have been taking photographs for more than 2 decades. Over the years I have developed my photography and ideas and set up several galleries from which I display and sell my work. More recently I have been teaching photography throughout Australia and internationally. My first love, however, is actually discovering and photographing unique places. Be it pristine wilderness or Industrial wastelands.<br>
 
I have won several awards including a top 10 in the Hasselblad Masters Awards and most recently the 2011 AIPP Australian Landscape Photographer of the year and 2011 AIPP Western Australian Landscape Photographer of the Year. I am a master photographer in the Australian Institute of Professional Photographers and my photographic galleries have won tourism awards for excellence.

									<div class="image-desc"><p>Copyright &copy; Alex Wise - Bay of Fires, TAS</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>bbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Iceland. The midnight sun and aurora's look stunning and something I'd love to experience.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
The Bay of Fires, Tasmania. Beautiful blue beaches with not a sole on them. It's a great place to escape to and even has some inland waterfalls not too far away from the main beach.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
I shoot with a DSLR setup that consists of a Canon 5D Mark II, Canon 17-40 wide angle lens, Canon 24-70 for a mid range zoom, Cokin Z-Pro graduated filters, B+W 110 filter and a tripod.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Slow down your process and try to take in the scene before you take out the camera. Often I'll arrive at a location and only take 1-3 photos over the course of a few hours. Quality over quantity is what's key for a good photo outing.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>

Generally when out I'll store my photos across multiple cards. It's more once I get home I'll quickly load them onto my computer and secondary backup then prepare them for backup at two external secure locations. I've lost images in the past due to hard drive failure so I'm not prepared to make the same mistakes again. As external hard drives become cheaper my biggest tip for new photographers is to go out and get yourself an extra hard drive and store it somewhere securely. It sure beats losing images.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>

Mobile phone photography is up there for me. There's some great photographers out there on Instagram taking photos that look like they were taken on a DSLR. Some of the apps like <a href="http://web.stagram.com/tag/avgcamerapro/"target="_blank">avgcamerapro</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/slow-shutter!/id616728746?mt=8 "target="_blank">slowshutter</a> are allowing photographers to take long exposures with their iPhone and the results are just amazing and go to show that you don't necessarily need an expensive camera to take a great photo.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>

One of my favourite travel locations is the Bay of Fires, Tasmania. I've always wanted to get home and go to the Bay of Fires in the hope of catching a great sunset. A few years ago now I made a trip up there with family and wasn't disappointed. The sunset was stunning as the colour remained in the sky for a good 30 minutes leaving lots of opportunities for photos. It was a great experience being in the right place at the right time and having my family by my side.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>

A hard one and it's probably <a href="http://www.alexwisephotography.net/blog/2010/02/12/liffey-falls-3/"target="_blank">this photo</a> I took at Liffey Falls in 2010. I travelled for 5 days around Tasmania and the weather was awful the whole time leaving not much opportunity for good photos. On my way back home to Hobart I made a stop at Liffey Falls and waded waist deep in water to get a slightly different angle of Liffey Falls. My camera got drenched but I think the result was worth it. It was one of those moments where after 5 days of miserable weather it paid off eventually.</p>

<p class="border"><span class="number">9</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite travel photography blog?</strong><br>
I find inspiration from a lot of photographers (not limited to travel) but one particular favourite is <a href="http://www.everlookphotography.com/"target="_blank">Everlook Photography</a>. Dylan and Marianne Toh travel to some stunning locations and always manage to walk away with beautiful photographs. Definitely worth a look if you're looking for inspiration before your next big trip.</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
My ultimate travel photography is above the Earth.  The world looks very different from the air, the colours, the topography of the landscape, the layouts of towns all take a more abstract viewpoint.  One of my favourite places in the world for aerial photography is here in Australia, over Whitehaven Beach, <a href="http://www.hotelclub.com/Australia/Whitsundays-hotels/"target="_blank">Whitsunday Islands</a> Queensland.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
Western Australia's vast coastline is heaven to travel and landscape photographers.  Pick any spot from Esperance to Kununurra and you will not be disappointed.  The most spectacular sunset and sunrise I have ever seen was at Monkey Mia with dolphins swimming up next to me.  For an unusual landscape photo that feels out of this world's check out  "The Pinnacles"  which are limestone formations contained within Nambung National Park, near the town of Cervantes.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
A tripod is absolutely essential but if the weight is too heavy I will use a mini tripod, which is not as sturdy but serves the purpose of slow shutter speed and night photography.  My photography backpack always has 2 camera bodies and my main camera is generally Nikon D800E camera body with a minimum of 3 lenses Nikon 14-24mm, 70-200mm, 24-70mm.   If I have the room I will add 105mm macro lens for close-ups and if I wish to shoot video my 50mm f18 will be tucked away with the gear too.  My MacBook Pro computer is another integral part of the kit and a hard drive to transfer and store my raw files.  Finally, I always take my mobile phone as I can also include excellent quality phone images as well as the high resolution camera files, that can be shared on numerous social media sites and instantly uploaded.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Sunrises and sunsets display magic light for images, beautiful skies, glimmering ripples on water, mountains may have a rim of golden hue capping their peaks and you have approximately 20 minutes of opportunity to capture this amazing light and make an ordinary shot look extraordinary. 
I use a great iPhone app called "Sun" which allows me to type in a location to check the sunset, sunrise, twilight and even has Google maps so you can zoom in and see where the light will be hitting and what the shadows will be covering. This is excellent if you want to photograph the exterior of a historical building.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
Because I shoot with the Nikon D800e the file sizes are very large and you are best to carry an external hard drive.  If I am in a situation that I cannot bring my external hard drive I have several memory cards all sitting in a small carry case with the label facing up if the memory cards have not been used. The memory card sizes I use are 64gb, 32gb, 16gb and 8gb.  If you are shooting video footage you may need more.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
The most exciting trend in photography this year is achieving beautiful rich colours especially with travel and landscapes as well as a "vintage" retro feel like old masters paintings.  Over 64% of people travelling today use their mobile phones to capture photography which has surpassed the point and shoot and DSLR camera user. A significant increase and a change of what equipment people take with them when.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
There are a series of photos I captured that I will cherish forever.  Images of sea lions swimming with me off the coast in Western Australia, photographing the very different culture in Japan and being welcomed by an elderly Japanese lady to come and dine with the family, flying over the Olgas at Sunset and hanging out of a helicopter to photograph the worlds biggest underpants.  All these events I have captured and all have a special story.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>

My most inspiring photography experience was with a man named Keith Hegge.  At 94 years of age Keith was Australia's oldest pilot and I had the sheer pleasure of going up in the clouds with him in a Cessna 172 plane.  I realised that age is no barrier, as long as you have passion and will you can achieve anything.  So I intend to be like Imogen Cunningham and keep photographing as long as I can hold a camera.</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Currently I'm very fond of Mongolia having just returned from leading a small group photo tour there. Great scenery, lots of culture and very friendly people.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
Australia - south west WA, from Bunbury around to Albany.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
Leica M with four lenses (18,24,35,75) for most things, and a Canon 5D Mk3 for timelapse and video.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Don't take too much gear. A couple of good zooms is all you really need and you have to carry it all safely and comfortably.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
On a second hard drive fitted within my Macbook Pro, with exact copies on an external hard drive.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
Higher quality photos on phones - sometimes you just need to grab a shot, and being able to make a decent print from a phone pic is very cool.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
After thirty years as a pro photographer I cannot name a single image as my one 'favourite'. Lots of photos have different significance for me but all the images on my website would count as my current favourites.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
Storms. I love huge black clouds and dramatic light, the whole spectacle makes me feel both humble and excited at the same time.</p>

    Nick Rains studied Zoology at Swansea University in South Wales before finding a passion for photography. Like many others were starting to do, he shouldered a backpack and headed off into Asia and Australia. He ended up working for Canon during the 1986 America's Cup in Fremantle, where he met top international photographers and magazine editors who were very helpful to a young photographer starting out in serious international work.<br>
    
In 1990, Nick decided to move back to Australia and has been shooting this fabulous country ever since.  He was named Australian Geographic Photographer of the Year in 2002 and has won the Nikon AIPP Landscape Photographer of the year twice.<br>

Nick is currently writing various magazines and also teaches photography "on location" on workshop tours and continues to shoot new images both in Australia and overseas.

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
I've spent a lot of time in Indonesia; as far as being a great place to hang out and interact with the locals it's hard to beat.  I've just come back from a shoot in Kakadu National Park, which was great.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
The World Heritage listed Dorrigo National Park up behind Coffs Harbour in New South Wales is fantastic.  If it were closer to Sydney it would be packed, though most of the time you can have many of the walks and waterfalls to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
It depends on the trip I'm taking.  A full bag of gear is two Canon bodies, a range of zoom lenses, a prime 50mm and some basic gear for an off camera flash setup for portraits.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>

Just to enjoy the process of taking pictures as much as you can without worrying too much about camera gear in the early stages.  That and to chase great light; with some planning/early starts you can see more of a place than you might have if you were not looking for great shots.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>

I have a small basic laptop which I use, along with two external hard drives that I back up to at the same time.  I always carry one drive with me in my camera bag, rather than keeping everything in one place. It's saved me a few times as things always seem to malfunction, especially in tropical heat.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>

I'm old fashioned and not on Instagram, which seems to be an ever growing monster.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>

It's probably one taken in Bali last year at the annual 'Bupati Cup' Bull Racing contest.  It was a stinking hot, dusty day and difficult to get decent shots without a cluttered background.  I found a little place to crouch down and waited.  Being Indonesia you can take pretty much any risk you want, so getting close for a wide angle shot was no problem.  The result ended up a widely published shot that reminds me of all the sounds and sights of the day.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>

I recently shot the Laura Dance Festival in Cape York.  It's held every two years and is highly recommended for anybody looking for positive and deep interaction with remote indigenous communities.</p>

<p class="border"><span class="number">9</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite travel photography blog?</strong><br>
Being honest I don't actually read them much.  Well before he had a blog the work of <a href="http://stevemccurry.com/"target="_blank">Steve Mccurry</a> was something that all photographers could aspire to, and his images still motivate me to keep working on my trade as much as the first time I saw them.</p>

Belgrade, Serbia. Amazing architecture, people, and light.</p>

Underwater photography at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia.</p>

Fuji X-Pro 1, 18mm lens, Leica flash.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Take as many photos as possible, and get someone who is a better photographer than you to provide feedback and practical criticism.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I store my backups on SD cards, as well as keeping a backup on both a portable hard drive, and a laptop.</p>


<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
Size matters. The DSLR is dead, especially for travellers. Cell phones continue to gain in photographic quality. Professional photographers are being beaten by amateurs.</p>


<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
I took a photo under a beautiful bridge in Esfahan, Iran. The light was perfect, there were people singing, hanging out, and even reciting poetry. I was warmly welcomed, and none of the locals had any problems as I went around taking photos.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
People are the most inspiring "thing" that I photograph! As a traveller who loves taking photos of strangers on the street, a photo can turn to a deep conversation in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p class="border"><span class="number">9</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite travel photography blog?</strong><br>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Antarctica! I have always had a passion for exploring remote wilderness locations and photographing these places is such a privilege. It doesn't get much more remote or wild than Antarctica.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
The coastal region in the South West of Western Australia is just stunning in terms of landscape photography. It's not just pretty white beaches (although there are lots of those!) – it is the more wild and rugged areas that I like, the ones you can only get to on foot.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
Canon DSLR, 24-70mm lens, 70-200mm lens, 50mm prime lens, tripod, filters (polariser, ND, and ND Grad).</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Above all else, photograph what you are passionate about! You will make your best pictures when you are photographing something you love.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I carry two external hard drives and back up all my images to both. As much as possible, I try to carry them separately.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
The continually improving system behind the mirrorless cameras is quite exciting for travel photographers. They are compact and lightweight with most of the perks of a DSLR: great for street photography or when you don't want to haul all your heavy gear up a mountain.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
It's so difficult to pick favourites as each image always has some kind of story behind it. One of my favourites though is this aerial photograph of the Alaska Range in Denali National Park. Despite my aversion to small planes I love seeing the earth from the air, particularly wild places like Denali. Flying at eye level to these mountain peaks you experience the ebb and flow of the elements from a completely different perspective. This shot was taken as the last few shards of light remained, just moments before the clouds tumbled over the mountains and engulfed them completely.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
In 2011, I took my first trip to the Arctic – an expedition to photograph the annual polar bear migration in the Canadian Arctic. The unique experience of photographing polar bears in the wild was quite literally awe-inspiring. Locking your gaze with a wild polar bear that is only a couple of meters away, is not something you are ever likely to forget.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Avoid cliched photos of tourist attractions. Savor the view and buy a postcard instead.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I don't like traveling with hard drives so I bring lots of memory cards and store them safely when they fill up.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
The resurgence of analogue photography.</p>


<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
Recently I have been shooting a lot of artists and their studios. Watching them work is particularly inspiring and the studios often have beautiful light.</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Antarctica is like stepping onto another planet, one of the last few unspoiled natural environments in the world.  The opportunity to photograph unique birds and animals in their natural environment feels like being in your own wildlife documentary.  And to do this in a landscape that feels like its been created with a palette of blue and white hues is simply magical.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.hotelclub.com/Australia/Kangaroo-Island-hotels/"target="_blank">Kangaroo Island</a> in the quiet season - great combination of wildlife and landscape opportunities without tourists walking into your frame.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
Canon 5D Mark II<br>
Canon 7D (as a backup body or for my 100-400mm when I want extra reach for wildlife)<br>
Lenses (17-40mm, 24-105mm, 100-400mm, 100mm Macro)<br>
Filters (ND, Grads, Polariser)<br>
Tripod (Gitzo 1542t)</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Don't pack your camera away when you get home.  Look at your home town through new eyes and use every opportunity to practise and improve your photography skills.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I am always paranoid about protecting my photos whilst travelling, I've heard too many horror stories!  I carry a handful of memory cards, download onto my Macbook Pro once or twice a day, and back up to a portable hard drive as soon as I need to re-use my memory card.  I always make sure I have at least two copies of my photos and also store online whenever I have reliable internet.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
The ongoing evolution of mobile photography and online sharing gives more people the chance to look at the world through different eyes.  It also challenges photographers to reassess their own methods and continue to push their creative limits as they search for ways to rise above the increasing competition.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
 I recently took this photograph (above) in Drakensberg, South Africa and consider it a favourite for two reasons:
- It felt "earned".  I had earlier spent an unsuccessful hour in another location with a group of other photographers, trying to shoot star trails.  A road we had not noticed lit up with unexpected cars and a curious security guard painted our foreground on a regular and frustrating basis.  After everyone gave up and went to bed, I went searching for a different location and feel my patience paid off with this shot.
- It reminds me of how much I enjoy being back in the Southern Hemisphere.  London has been my base for the past decade, but I'll always be Australian and the Milky Way and star-filled sky feels symbolic of the country I'm from.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
Photographing Pleneau Bay from a zodiac in Antarctica is going to be hard to beat.  The volume and scale of the icebergs scattered around the bay (an area known as Iceberg Graveyard) was overwhelming and reminded me I was on an unspoiled continent that plays by its own rules.
The leopard seal swimming under our zodiac and the one growling at us from an ice floe, reminded me that I was a visitor in their world.  
And the unexpected wave created by a calving iceberg reminded me how quickly things can change.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I download to a laptop then backup to 3 separate external hard drives, which I keep in different parts of my luggage. Cameras can be replaced; images cannot.</p>

Smartphone cameras, esp the Nokia 1020.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
One evening, I went for a flight over the Namib Desert out to the Atlantic Ocean and back, in a light plane. I went nuts, filling 80Gb of cards. As we passed over Dune 44 in Sossus, Namibia, I made an image  of the dune from the air. It hangs on my wall as the perfect expression of the soul of Afrika.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>

One day, as a storm was retreating, I looked down from the summit of the Borland Saddle into the Grebe Valley in Fiordland, New Zealand. It was wild, sensual and challenging. working in a 40 knot wind, It called on every skill I had to document the soul of the mystery which is Fiordland.</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
I am dreaming about Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia. Both countries have intricate tribal communities I'd love to spend time with. Otherwise, I spent a lot of time in Argentina and took some incredible photos of Gauchos.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
Lady Elliot Island, a small piece of land off the southern most tip of the Great Barrier Reef. It is a hub for sea turtles and other marine life, so even if you are an amateur, you're going to get incredible underwater shots. This area of the reef is less visited than the more popular Cairns, so some divers contend it maintains a unique richness of wildlife. Don't miss turtle hatching season.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
I like being lightweight, so my kit is really simple. I carry a Nikon D60 with two lenses, a silver and gold reflector, multiple SanDisk cards, a 1 terabyte Western Digital external hard drive, and my laptop.
For short and simple videos, I use a Canon Powershot, an XShot camera extender, H1 Digital Audio Recorder by Zoom, and a lavaliere. </p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Don't worry about buying top of the line equipment, especially starting out. When I took my first digital SLR basics course at Brooks Institute in the US, I was the only one there with a point and shoot. People laughed at me, but I didn't care because I was hungry to learn. I still don't shoot with top of the line gear. What matters more is your creative vision and the interaction with people. Keep the focus on the artwork not on who owns what. </p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I travel with a Western Passport one terabyte external hard drive formatted for Mac. I'll keep one copy of photos on my computer and one on my hard drive, but I am now considering getting an extra drive and doing an additional backup. I lost my photos once and it was devastating, so backup your stuff.</p>


<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
I value disconnecting from the web to connect with rural communities through photography, so the fact that you can buy WiFi cards and upload direct to web kind of makes me cringe. The Canon 6D is also outfitted with WiFi capability if that's your jam. Shamelessly that's also the camera I am considering upgrading to, so we'll see if I change my ways.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
At the San Telmo markets in Buenos Aires, I captured an intimate portrait of street performing tango dancers. I shot it as a close-up, and I just love the expression of passion on their faces and the closeness between them. I also love the colors.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
Also when I lived in Argentina, I spent a lot of time in and around Gaucho communities in the north. They are such fierce yet gentle people with heart-felt patriotism for their homeland. I was amazed every time I saw a Gaucho get on a horse because they rode with such confidence, so I value all of the shots in that set.</p>

<p class="border"><span class="number">9</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite travel photography blog?</strong><br>

Understand the light. Know when it i best to shoot the scene that you are shooting.Understand light and you'll improve your shots 100%.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
It's not so much a trend, but it is the ever changing face of photography. The technology is ever changing so quickly that as each year passes, so many new opportunities are open to you which is awesome. Who knows where photography will be in just 5 years from now.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
It's Called " The Wave" shot in Arizona. It's my favourite as it is so different, I've need seen a rock scape like this anywhere in the world. It's imposing and inspiring.It's a 2 hour hike in and when you arrived at the spot, you are looking around for it and you don't realise until you get to the top but you are actually walking through The Wave. The colours, textures and endless photographic opportunities leave you in awe.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
For those who know my work, will understand the answer to this. The skies/clouds are the most inspiring thing for me to shoot. I love an awesome sky above any landscapes as the skies in my humble opinion bring alive the landscape.</p>

<p class="border"><span class="number">9</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite travel photography blog?</strong><br>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
I  have so many ultimate travel destinations, however  I have recently discovered South East Asia and it's rich culture and amazingly warm people. Burma is therefore high up on my list.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
I don't know whether this area is much of a secret, however many, many years ago before I became seriously interested in photography I travelled and hiked the Bay of Fires on the east coast of Tasmania, a magnificent, remote and pristine area of Australia.  I would love to go back and photograph this absolute gem.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
I have a Nikon D700 and usually have my favourite lens attached to it, the Nikon 24mm to 70mm.  I also always travel with my lighter and lovely little Fuji X100.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Don't weigh yourself down with too much equipment that you may probably not even use. Travel as light as you can and enjoy the journey.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I take my MacBook Pro and external hard drives with me.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
I don't really follow trends, I am just treading my own path and taking my own creative journey.</p>


<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
It's very difficult to pinpoint a favourite photo so I will mention a photo that touches my heart for personal reasons.  It was taken in Luang Prabang in Laos.<br>
 
On my first day there I wandered into one of the many monasteries and started to chat with one of the Novice monks in the grounds. After having chatted to him for close to an hour he invited me into his temple.  It was here that I took my first photo of him standing by one of the beautifully decorated windows.<br>
 
We have since become firm friends and skype and email each other regularly.  He has left the monastery and is now studying commerce in Luang Prabang and doing extremely well.</p>

Once again I think this would be in Laos.  The alms giving in the early morning is awe-inspiring.<br>
 
Around 6am each morning the Buddhist monks from the many monasteries in Luang Prabang take to the streets barefoot and clothed in their colorful robes to receive offerings from the locals (and tourists) who line the streets of the town.  It takes the monks around 40 minutes to make their route each morning after which time they head back to their monastery to have their breakfast (the offerings).  It is a magical ritual, very peaceful, spiritual and incredibly beautiful to photograph.</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
The Great Barrier Reef.  Stretching over 2300km, it changes as you head from one end to the other and there always new photographic opportunities.  In the far north reaches (north of Cooktown) there are some amazing hidden spots that few people ever get to.  Idyllic sand cays, beautiful islands and, of course, coral reefs teeming with life and each unique - no two reefs are the same!  Lady Elliott Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef has turtle nesting and manta rays that come to visit, Airlie Beach offers the Whitsunday Islands, Townsville the Yongala Wreck and Cairns has a wide variety of reef opportunities.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
Underwater in Victoria.  Cold water isn't always appealing, especially when you reside in the tropics!  But, the underwater life off Victoria's beaches is rich in colour and vibrancy.  There are the beautifully coloured sponges, strange looking sea dragons and plenty of masters of camouflage that make for great underwater portraits.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
I use Canon 7Ds with an Aquatica underwater housing, a range of lenses and Sea & Sea underwater strobes (flashes).</p>
  
<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Back up. back up. back up.  Whether it is adding your favourite photos to a photo-sharing website like Flickr or copying some to a portable hard drive it is just so important, and so easy.  Losing your travel memories and photographs is avoidable.  I am going to sneak a second tip in... take a spare battery (or two!).</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I always travel with my laptop and portable hard drives to back up my photos.  If I cannot take my laptop then a good stock of memory cards in a waterproof container.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
I think for traveling photographers the continued refinement of super-zooms lenses is a great trend.  Of course they have trade-off's but it isn't always possible to take a large collection of lenses with you.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
I have an image that I took while being circled by manta rays in the Coral Sea off Queensland at an isolated oceanic reef called Osprey Reef.  It was a very special moment, and the photography had three of the manta rays in different poses and just represents, to me, that moment very clearly.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
Dwarf minke whales... more specifically their eyes.  All encounters with these beautiful whales are on their terms thanks to a very carefully planned ecotourism industry and you are never really sure who is watching who.  Their eyes are just amazing and you cannot help but wonder what they see on their long ocean voyages.</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
I would love to explore South America.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
This isn't a very well kept secret, but Milford Sound was probably the most beautiful place I have ever photographed. I also like to photograph/hang out on beaches in Victoria with lovely cliffs like Point Addis and Half Moon Bay. </p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
I usually bring my 5D Mark II and 50mm 1:4 or 24-70mm 2.8 lenses. It's a heavy load but you get used to it. </p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Get to know your camera very well before you start travelling. You don't want to be fiddling around with your settings when you need to capture an image on the go.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I have a collection of memory cards. When I have free time I import the photos onto my laptop and clean out my cards. It's important to always bring spare memory cards and batteries when travelling.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
I know Instagram has been out for a few years now but I feel like it's still getting bigger. I love how it makes photography more accessible to everyone and I love using it myself.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>

The photo featured above was taken from a bus driving back from Milford Sound. The sunset peeking out from behind the mountains just looked surreal so I had to take a photograph.</p>

<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>

<a href="http://jeanninetan.com/content/20.work/19.travel/1-28.jpg"target="_blank">This photo</a> was taken on a $50 compact camera.

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
Antarctica.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
The Blue Lake at St Bathans, Central Otago, South Island.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
It depends on the shoot. If it is a full commercial shoot I will take my pro bag which contains a Nikon D3, 14-24, 24-70, 70-200mm F2.8 Nikon lenses plus an old 16mm fisheye. Also SB800 flash, cable releases, remotes, tripod etc.<br>
For a quick lightweight kit I use a Panasonic Lumix GF2 with a gorgeous 7-14mm F4 zoom lens. I also have a Recsea housing for this camera so I can use it underwater. I will often also take a Go Pro Hero 2 and use it on a Camera pole.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Always carry a spare fully charged camera battery. Have your camera always set on Aperture priority at F8 and the ISO set at ISO 400. These settings will usually enable you to grab the camera, switch it on and shoot immediately with a fast enough shutter speed to match your lens. All you need to concentrate on is composing the image and selecting the best viewpoint. Be able to recognize a great photo and never miss your best opportunity to capture it.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
My Nikon D3 has two slots for compact flash cards. This enable me to use two 64 GB cards, enough to shoot for two weeks without storing images elsewhere. Make photography as simple as possible is my philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
The development and constant improvement of mirrorless compact cameras. They are so small, light, easy to use and give amazing results. I dont really follow other people's photo trends. I try to create photo trends of my own by thinking outside the square! I like people to react to my photos with comments like "wow, how did you do that?"</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
My favourite photo is of a whale shark in Vava'u, Tonga.
On day four, after a number of hours searching, we struggled to find a good whale encounter. Moa, our female skipper received a call from another boat and we were soon alongside it. "Get ready" she called to us. I looked around and could not see a humpback anywhere in sight. "Where is the whale?" I asked. She quickly responded, "Trust me. Swim that way. GO, GO, GO". I slid gently into the water, camera in hand. The boat's propeller had caused aerated water like a fog and I swam blindly through it. When I emerged into clear water I was greeted by an enormous whale shark, only 3 or 4 metres away and coming straight at me! I tried to gather my senses and back peddled furiously to one side to avoid a head on collision with this monster. It slid past me very close and all I could see was white spots! Even though the fish appeared to swim very slowly there was no way of keeping up with it. We returned to the boat, moved ahead of it and then jumped in again. This time I was ready. ISO 320 and an aperture of F8 gave me a shutter speed of 1/180th second. Even with the Tokina lens at its widest setting of 11mm I had to move back to get the whole whale shark in the picture area.<br>

At 12 to 14 metres the whale shark is the world's largest fish and seeing a snorkeler behind it gives you an appreciation of how big it really is. We swam beside it for a whole 90 minutes in water which was 1000 metres deep with visibility of 70 metres plus. It doesn't get much better than that! I have been diving since 1973 and this was without doubt my best encounter ever and beyond my wildest dreams.</p>

<p><span class="number">1</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your ultimate travel photography destination?</strong><br>
I would love to go on safari in Africa and also take a hot air balloon to catch some of the animals from above.</p>

<p><span class="number">2</span><strong>&nbsp; What in your opinion is Australia / New Zealand's best kept secret photographic gem?</strong><br>
In New Zealand I would have to say the West Coast of the South Island. Especially the little town of Karamea and the Oparara Basin nearby. In Australia, I would say the forest areas along the Great Ocean Road. Everyone heads straight for the coast but if you take the time to travel on the inland roads as well you'll discover the Redwood Forest, waterfalls and other amazing spots to photograph.</p>

<p><span class="number">3</span><strong>&nbsp; What camera equipment do you take on the road?</strong><br>
Filter, lens cleaner and cleaning cloths, splash proof jacket for the camera/lens, infrared remote for the shutter, and lots of large SD cards 16GB upwards.</p>

<p><span class="number">4</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your number 1 tip for amateur travel photographers?</strong><br>
Travel light. Have an idea of what you want to take photos of and where. That way you can plan what gear to take so you aren't carrying around equipment you won't use.</p>

<p><span class="number">5</span><strong>&nbsp; How do you store your photo's while on the road?</strong><br>
I carry around an apply MacBook Pro or MacBook Air which I store photos on, plus the SD cards, and also I back them up on a portable external hard drive. That was if one fails or you lose it, you at least have back ups to fall back on. And believe me something will fail or get lost as some point.</p>

<p><span class="number">6</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most exciting photography trend of 2013?</strong><br>
Other than the rise in mobile phone photography, and timelapse photography, I think the trend I like the most is that printing is coming back into favour. As the digital age progresses, we print our photos less and less, however, the rise and low cost of creating photo books, photo blocks and other cool bits and bobs, now means that we are once again printing out and enjoying our work a lot more.</p>

<p><span class="number">7</span><strong>&nbsp; What's your favourite photograph of your own? tell us about the story behind it.</strong><br>
I have so many travel photos that I love, but I find the one I love the most and makes me smile was taken in my own back yard. Before the earthquakes in Christchurch, NZ, I had planted sunflower seeds in the garden. They hadn't really grown and I'd almost given up on them and forgotten about them completely. After the big earthquake, I would go outside each morning to have a look at the neighbourhood which had changed so dramatically. It was then that I noticed that all the liquefaction in the garden had somehow fertilised the sunflowers and they'd come out in full bloom. The Monarch Butterfly was flittering from one sunflower to the next, resting gently on them. I watched him for hours and took this photo which I still love to this day. Every morning for 2 weeks I would come out and the butterfly would be there on the sunflowers. It certainly cheered me up in a time full of stress and uncertainty.</p>


<p><span class="number">8</span><strong>&nbsp; What's the most inspiring thing you have photographed?</strong><br>
I recently went on a night photography tour around <a href="http://www.hotelclub.com/Australia/Melbourne-hotels"target="_blank">Melbourne</a> with a company called Australian Photo Tours. It was a great night and really got me excited about night photography which is something I hadn't really done before. It was also great to explore more of this great city that I now live in.</p>
