Accompanied by Hong Kong’s local jazz musicians, Morrison’s programme will take in everyone from Armstrong to Zawinul, with plenty of stops along the way. Interestingly, Morrison has chosen to tackle his subject alphabetically, with a systematic rigour almost at odds with the genre’s dedication to freewheeling improvisation. No matter: the evening promises to be a master class in performance, guaranteed to sate the cravings of even the pickiest jazz-head. <br /><br />Tickets range from HK$140 to HK$380, with Young Audience Scheme members enjoying a 55% discount (10% for accompanying adults).

In a last-ditch attempt at appeasing the gods, the locals built an altar and began dancing through the streets dressed up as deities. When the plague soon lifted, it quickly became tradition to re-enact these rituals every year. Fast forward to the present and a desperate attempt to ward off death has transformed into a jolly ceremony, complete with a bizarre ‘bun scrambling’ ritual: involving scaling three large bamboo towers studded with freshly-baked buns. One of the strangest festivals on Earth, this joyous celebration of survival should be a priority for any visitor. <br /><br />Attendance is as easy as simply turning up, and everyone is welcome.

With over 30,000 active paddlers across the region, there is no shortage of races to watch; but for most visitors their first encounter with the sport will come during the annual Dragon Boat Festival. Like the Grand National and Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race rolled into one, the Festival sees up to a dozen simultaneous races take place across HK, each accompanied by cheering punters and shrieking fans. Although all are guaranteed to be entertaining, first-timers should head to Stanley for the biggest of the lot. In 2014, some 30,000 gathered to watch and cheer the winners on. <br /><br />Attendance is free and requires no more planning than simply showing up. Be sure to arrive early if you want to get a good view, as large crowds tend to gather a good hour before the races start. ',

Traditionally, the seventh month of the lunar calendar is thought to be the time when restless spirits return to wander the Earth, and many families will burn fake paper money or leave out food to appease the ghosts. <br /><br />For visitors, the festival offers a chance to connect with HK’s culture on a visceral level, or simply observe the many celebrations. Among the most-interesting to foreigners are the practice of lighting large roadside pyres, and the performance of Chinese Operas from atop temporary bamboo stages. If you miss the festival proper, HK’s Chiu Chow community celebrate for the entire month, putting on plays and celebrations in their neighbourhoods. ',

Starting at 11pm, fireworks will blaze a trail across the sky and lightshows sweep the nearby skyscrapers, building up to an explosive climax as we roll into 2016. Previous year’s post-midnight displays have lasted a full 8 minutes and have attracted hundreds of thousands of spectators. It’s hoped that this year’s will be even louder, longer and madder. <br /><br />There are venues where you can pay to watch the fireworks from a viewing platform, but we recommend simply heading down to the waterfront and finding a place among the crowd. Frankly, there’s no better way to soak up the atmosphere of HK’s wild NYE. ',

Between now and 26th December, a marathon retrospective of the films of the “four clown masters” – Liu Hap-wai, Lee Hoi-chuen, Poon Yat On and Yip Fut-yeuk – has been arranged; taking in classics, rarities and the only surviving film of both Liu and Yip. Starting out as players of the oft-minor ‘clown’ role in Cantonese Opera, the four became renowned for their affecting turns as ordinary folk, beggars, down-and-outs and cross-dressers (although Yip had a profitable side line in court officials). For fans of classic Sino cinema, this is one to pencil into the diary. <br/><br/>Screenings take place most Fridays in the on-site cinema until 26th Dec. Tickets are HK$20 for each showing, with advance booking advisable. Those interested should note that all screenings take place at 11am. ',

        text: 'After over a decade mainly based in Europe (bar one quick visit to Japan), the BoDW finally makes it to Asia proper, bringing in its wake all sorts of assorted items, ideas and grand visions. Visitors can expect seminars on everything from video games to product branding to creating sustainable, dynamic cities. Unabashedly for professionals and the ‘in-crowd’, BoDW boasts that only 10 percent of its visitors are drawn from the general public. However, if you’re in the business of design, this is an opportunity you shouldn’t miss. <br /><br />Those who wish to purchase tickets will first need to register online. Full passes will be available to purchase, or alternatively half-day passes will also be on sale for those interested in a particular talk. ',

        text: 'A vast, outdoor trades-fair situated in Hong Kong’s gorgeous Victoria Park, the Brands and Products Expo features over 800 booths and more networking opportunities than you could shake a proverbial stick at. For industry insiders, it’s a good way to promote business, build contacts and attend seminars. For the general public, it’s a fascinating way to while away an afternoon, pick up early Christmas gifts or simply try out the multitude of free samples on display. <br /><br />Ticket prices have yet to be confirmed, but senior citizens (over 65) can attend for free. There are also a couple of ‘senior’s days’ spread out over the Expo, for those who’d rather avoid the crowds. Some children will be admitted free of charge, but only those under one metre in height.
